Book Search Engine

## Description

The Book Search app is designed to help users find and manage their favorite books. Here's a description of the app based on the given acceptance criteria:

When you load the Book Search Engine, you are presented with a user-friendly menu that includes two options: "Search for Books" and "Login/Signup." Additionally, there is an input field to search for books and a submit button.

Clicking on the "Search for Books" menu option or using the dedicated input field and submit button allows you to search for books. Even if you're not logged in, entering a search term and clicking the submit button provides you with several search results. Each result includes the book's title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.

To access additional features, click on the "Login/Signup" menu option. This action triggers a modal to appear on the screen, offering you the choice to either log in or sign up. If you select the "Signup" toggle, you are presented with three input fields for a username, email address, and password, along with a signup button. Conversely, selecting the "Login" toggle provides two input fields for an email address and password, accompanied by a login button.

When you enter a valid email address, create a password, and click the signup button, your user account is successfully created, and you are automatically logged into the site. Similarly, entering your account's email address and password and clicking the login button logs you into the site, closing the modal in the process.

Once you are logged into the site, the menu options change to "Search for Books," an option to "See My Saved Books," and "Logout." This updated menu allows you to explore the saved books in your account. When you enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button while logged in, you receive search results as before, with the addition of a button to save a book to your account.

Clicking on the "Save" button for a book adds its information to your account, ensuring you can easily find and manage your favorite reads. To view the books you've saved, simply click on the option to "See My Saved Books." This action presents you with a list of all the books you have saved, displaying each book's title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site. Furthermore, there is a button provided to remove a book from your account if desired.

To log out of the site, click on the "Logout" button. This action logs you out and takes you back to the initial menu, featuring the options "Search for Books" and "Login/Signup." Additionally, you'll find the input field to search for books and the submit button, allowing you to continue exploring and managing your book collection.
